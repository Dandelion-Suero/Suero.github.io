I used the program Adobe Photoshop to create my character, Skia. 
I started by looking at my old works and seeing what characters I've made but never expanded on. 
I really wanted to make a hero story but with a bit of a fun twist. 
So instead of a human seeking out greater power I made a shadow person who happened to be in the right place at the right time. 
Skia starts out with a tattered cloak and a rank 1 traveler status.
Skia has a commission to find a dog that ran off into the woods, while in their search they find the legendary sword that talks! 
Well.. nags.. It's unsatisfied with the young travelerâ€™s complacency and decides to punish the Traveler by making them help wherever it is needed.

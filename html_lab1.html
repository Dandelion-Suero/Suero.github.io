  <h1>life</h1>

<body>
  <br>It all started when i was born.
  i almost drowned when i was 5. my aunt took away my stuffed animals when i was small and now i collect them.
  i have never been to a sleepover and ive never had cottage cheese. I love foxes and peruvian foods. i am half peruvian
  and half puerto rican.<br>

  <br>My birthday is september 7th which makes me a virgo and i was born in the year of the rooster, 2005. i am 17 years
  old and ive been drawing since i was 7 and i used to hate the color pink but now i love it. ive always felt
  disconnected from my family and other people in general, purple is my least favorite color and i like hummus.<br>
  <br> I really like anime and cartoons with a deep plot and good characters.i love sad songs and funny slice of life
  comics. i like writing stories and poems about my expirences and how sad life can be but the fact that i can feel
  anything after 17 long years of life makes me hopeful.<br>
  
  <h2> Before BECA<h2>
  <br>
  <p> i was bullied in my old school (pre-k to 5th grade). I had terrible teachers that were only there for the paycheck,
  in result i lost my interest in learning. I only had one teacher that cared about me and she was my choir teacher. I was alone most of the time and 
  had way too much time.</p>
    <br>
  <h2> After changing to BECA<h2>
    <br>
    <p> I finally made frinds that cared about me and had fun, suddenly i was surrounded by teachers who cared about their students
    and loved what they taught. I was able to connect with so many people like me and i started to love school, suddenly it wasn't unbareable.
    First it wa smath with Mr. Blanchard and then it was science with Ms. Spaeth, and English with Dr. Ramey. all these teachers have changed my outlook on
    learning.</p>

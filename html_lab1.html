  <h1>life</h1>

<body>
  <br>It all started when i was born.
  i almost drowned when i was 5. my aunt took away my stuffed animals when i was small and now i collect them.
  i have never been to a sleepover and ive never had cottage cheese. I love foxes and peruvian foods. i am half peruvian
  and half puerto rican.<br>

  <br>My birthday is september 7th which makes me a virgo and i was born in the year of the rooster, 2005. i am 17 years
  old and ive been drawing since i was 7 and i used to hate the color pink but now i love it. ive always felt
  disconnected from my family and other people in general, purple is my least favorite color and i like hummus.<br>
  <br> I really like anime and cartoons with a deep plot and good characters.i love sad songs and funny slice of life
  comics. i like writing stories and poems about my expirences and how sad life can be but the fact that i can feel
  anything after 17 long years of life makes me hopeful.<br>
